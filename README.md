# Homebrew Tap for Universal Ctags

Given the lack of activity on the official Exuberant Ctags source,
it has been forked and renamed to Universal Ctags and can be found
at https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags.

## Usage

```
brew tap universal-ctags/universal-ctags
brew install --HEAD universal-ctags
```

## Future

When Universal Ctags has a tagged release, this formula should be moved
to the official Homebrew repository. This repo should then be deleted.
