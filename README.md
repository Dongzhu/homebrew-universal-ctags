# Homebrew Tap for Universal Ctags

Given the lack of activity on the official Exuberant Ctags source,
it has been forked and renamed to Universal Ctags. Universal Ctags
will eventually live in the [universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags)
Github organization.

For now, it still lives at https://github.com/fishman/ctags.

## Usage

```
brew tap cweagans/universal-ctags
brew install --HEAD universal-ctags
```

## Future

Hopefully, this tap won't exist under my username for too long. One of two
things should happen (in order of preference):

1. The formula should be merged into the official Homebrew formulae; or
2. The tap should be moved into the universal-ctags organization.
